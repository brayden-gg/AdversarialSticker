# Adversarial Sticker

## A CSCI1952Q Final Project

### Brayden Goldstein-Gelb

Steps:

-   Clone this repo and install the required libraries
-   Generate a sticker by running `python generate_sticker.py`. It will be outputted at the directory specified in the file, currently `./outputs`.
-   Print out the sticker, take pictures of it next to objects in the [ImageNet Class List](https://deeplearning.cms.waikato.ac.nz/user-guide/class-maps/IMAGENET/) and put those photos in the `./experiment` folder
-   Run `python get_results.py` to save the results to the `results.csv` file.

The results of my experiments are currently in these folders for transparency but feel free to remove them and try on your own.
