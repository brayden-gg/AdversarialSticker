# Adversarial Sticker

## A CSCI1952Q Final Project

### Brayden Goldstein-Gelb

Generate a sticker by running `python generate_sticker.py`. Then print it out, take pictures of it next to objects in the ImageNet classlist and put those photos in the `./experiment` folder. Finally, run `python get_results.py` to save the results to the `results.csv` file.

The results of my experiments are currently in these folders for transparency but feel free to remove them and try on your own.
